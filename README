This app is intended to make it easier to add TIGER/Line data to a GeoDjango project and save people from writing this same code over and over (collectively).

It is not (yet) exhaustive, it's just what I had and have needed in the past.
If you have models / load scripts for other data in the set, please fork/add and send me a pull request if you add other shapefiles. If you come up with useful manager methods, I'd love to see those too.

* NOTE: If you need cities, the best source for that is the US National Atlas. I have an app for those at https://github.com/adamfast/usgsdata-citiesx020

It's been tested and used with Django 1.8 and PostGIS + PostgreSQL. I've used it with other versions since 1.1 over time but it's probably best on 1.6+ now.

Install
-------

Download the 2015 Tigerline files for all zipcodes, all states, and all counties

ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2015/

* Zipcode Tabulation Areas (for all states) - see ZCTA5/ folder, download tl_2015_us_zcta510.zip
* States (and Equivalents) (for all states) - see STATE/ folder, download tl_2015_us_state.zip
* Counties (and Equivalents) (for all states) - see COUNTY/ folder, download tl_2015_us_county.zip

Unzip the files

Configure django.contrib.gis as described in the django docs.

Add "django.contrib.gis" and "tigerline" to INSTALLED_APPS

run `python manage.py migrate` which will run the migrations and make sure database tables are created.

If you want to import all three:
run `python manage.py load_tigerline --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`

Or there are individual management commands if you only need one set:
run `python manage.py load_counties --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_states --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_zipcodes --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`

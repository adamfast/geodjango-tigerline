This app is intended to make it easier to add TIGER/Line data to a GeoDjango project and save people from writing this same code over and over (collectively).

It is not (yet) exhaustive, it's just what I had and have needed in the past.
If you have models / load scripts for other data in the set, please fork/add and send me a pull request if you add other shapefiles. If you come up with useful manager methods, I'd love to see those too.

It's been tested and used with Django 1.1 to 1.4 and PostGIS + PostgreSQL. ORM freezing South
migrations are included as well, I'm currently using the 0.7.3 version.

Install
-------

Download the 2010 Tigerline files for all zipcodes, all states, and all counties

http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles2010/main

* Zipcode Tabulation Areas (for all states)
* States (and Equivalents) (for all states)
* Counties (and Equivalents) (for all states)

Unzip the files

Configure django.contrib.gis as described in the django docs.

Add "django.contrib.gis" and "tigerline" to INSTALLED_APPS

run `python manage.py syncdb` or `python manage.py migrate` as approporiate

If you want to import all three:
run `python manage.py load_tigerline --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`

Or there are individual management commands if you only need one set:
run `python manage.py load_counties --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_states --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`
run `python manage.py load_zipcodes --path=~/Path/to/shapefiles`

Merged updated loader files (compatible through 2016 versions) also from GitHub contributors billyburly and jlillest.
Tested with Django 1.11.

1.0.1   9/10/2015
Tested with Django 1.8 and upgraded loaders to work with latest 2015 edition of TIGER/LINE.

... no new PyPI releases. I'm terrible for that. But as time went on I had added 2012/2013/2014 load capability.

Tested up to Django 1.2, loaders for TIGER/LINE 2010/2011
